# AmyWinehouseMusicPlayer

<b> A Multi-Screen app that displays Amy Winehouse's albums. Clicking on an album directs the user to the list of tracks
on the corresponding album. </b> 

<p> Project #4 for the <b>Android Basics Nanodegree</b> by Google </p>

<p> This app focuses on combining various concepts in order to build a multi-screen app. I created an Amy Winehouse music app using 
Intents, New Activities, Arraylists, Loops and Custom Classes. My music app displays the list of available albums and songs
in a ListView. Clicking on an album navigates the user to the list of tracks using explicit intents to navigate around the app. 
A custom class stores information about each album. The purpose of each activity is easy for the user to understand through the UI 
design and labeling. </p>

<b> For this project, it was not required for the app to play music. To improve my Amy Winehouse music player app, 
I will add a MediaPlayer class to my project so that clicking on a track will play the song. </b> 

Core Concepts I learned Completing this Project:
----------------------------------------------
-	Creating new activities
-	Using explicit Intents to link between activities
-	Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code
-	Creating my own Custom Class
-	Looping through an ArrayList
-	Populating a ListView with an ArrayAdapter
-	Selecting proper data structs to store lists of information
-	Building layouts to display those lists of data
-	Navigating between lists in Fragments using a ViewPager plus TabLayout
-	Properly handling images
